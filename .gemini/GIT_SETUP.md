# Git Actions Setup - DONE ✅

## 1. CI Workflow Created
File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

This workflow triggers on `push` to `main` (or `master`) and `pull_request` to:
- Checkout code
- Setup PHP 8.3
- Install Composer dependencies
- Run Linting (Pint)
- Run Tests (PHPUnit/Pest)

## 2. Changes Committed
I have executed the following Git commands for you:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete localization and branding setup"
```

All your changes (Translations, Localization Fixes, Branding, and the new CI Workflow) are now saved in your local git history.

## Next Steps
To push these changes to GitHub (if you have a remote set up):
```bash
git push origin main
```
(Or `git push origin master` depending on your branch name).

**Status: COMMITTED & CI READY** 🚀
